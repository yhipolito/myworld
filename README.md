# Overview

I want to demonstrate the application of Django features on the creation of a WebApp.

I have created a WebApp that interacts with a SQL databases that came with Django, to start a test server on my laptop I used the command "python3 manage.py runserver". after that I am able to use the following URL on my browser http://127.0.0.1:8000/members/

The purpose of writing this software is to keep a basic track of my family members. This is a basic sample that maybe used to create a larger WebApp to register users.
